## Datasets

1. Original related tables:
   
   - **Career.xlsx**
   - **Company.xlsx**
   - **Companies Crunchbase.xlsx**
   - **Crunchbase Company Match.xlsx**
   - **Acquisitions.xlsx**
   - **Investment Round.xlsx**

2. SQL code to connect tables:

```sql
% Combine the three tables to calculate the company value, the detailed code for calculating company value can be found in python.
CREATE TABLE crunchbaseID_combined AS
SELECT 
    CC.`CrunchbaseID`,
    CC.`Number Of Employees`,
		CC.`Estimated Revenue Range`,
		CC.`Number Of Founders`,
		CC.`Acquisition Status`,
		CC. `Number Of Acquisitions`,
		CC.`Acquisition Type` AS CC_Acquisition_Type,
		CC.`Ipo Status`,
		CC.`Valuation At Ipo (in Usd)`,
		CC.`SEMrush Average Visits (6 Months)`,
    IR.`Funding Type`,
		IR.`Money Raised Currency (in Usd)`,
		IR.`Announced Date`,
		IR.`Funding Stage`,
		IR.`Pre Money Valuation Currency (in Usd)`,
		IR.`Equity Only Funding`,
		IR.`Cb Rank (Funding Round)`,
		A.`Price (in Usd)`,
		A.`Acquisition Type` AS A_Acquisition_Type,
		A.`Acquisition Terms`,
		A.`Cb Rank (Acquisition)`
FROM
    `Companies Crunchbase` CC
LEFT JOIN
    `Investment Round` IR ON CC.`CrunchbaseID` = IR.`CrunchbaseID`
LEFT JOIN
    `Acquisitions` A ON CC.`CrunchbaseID` = A.`CrunchbaseID`;
```

```sql
%Combine the filtered crunchbase companies(companies with company value) to related career records of founders.
CREATE TABLE Filtered_crunchbaseID_career_combined AS
SELECT 
    FC. `company_value`,
    FC.`CrunchbaseID`,
    CO.`Company Name`, 
    CO.`Industries`, 
    CO.`Headquarters Location`,  
    CO.`Founded Date`,  
    CO.`Number Of Employees`, 
    CA.*  
FROM
    `Filtered_crunchbaseID` FC
LEFT JOIN
    `Companies` CO ON CO.`CompanyID` = FC.`CompanyID`
LEFT JOIN
    `Career` CA ON CA.`CompanyID` = FC.`CompanyID`;
```

3. Industry verticals:

   - **Verticals.xlsx**: Contains descriptions of all 59 verticals.
  
   - **Verticals_after_clustering.xlsx**: Combined version of 42 verticals after k-means clustering.

4. Manually Labeled Companies:

   - **labelled_data.csv**: 241 companies labeled with proper verticals for NLP models.
  
5. Cleaned Dataset:
   
   - **career_founder_records.csv**: Cleaned via "Define company value and Data filtering.ipynb", excluding LSE founded companies with unavailable values. Filtered the career records of LSE founders with available company value.

6. Final dataset for prediction model:
   
   - **final_result_df.csv**: Generated by "Data preprocessing for prediction model.ipynb", including useful variables for the prediction model and the NLP result as the Vertical variable.


## Part 1: NLP Files

There are three methods used to classify companies into industry verticals:

   - [**Unsupervised_NLP.ipynb**](Unsupervised_NLP.ipynb)
  
   - [**Supervised_NLP.ipynb**](Supervised_NLP.ipynb)

   - [**In_context_NLP.ipynb**](In_context_NLP.ipynb)

We employed the result from supervised learning: SVM using OneVsRest for a multi-classification problem with the all-mpnet-base-v2 embedding method.

## Part 2: Prediction Model Files

   - [**Define company value and Data filtering.ipynb**](Define_company_value_and_Data_filtering.ipynb): Filters all LSE founders and companies in their career path, calculates company values, and excludes companies with unavailable values
  
   - [**Data preprocessing for prediction model.ipynb**](Data_preprocessing_for_prediction_model.ipynb): Calculates all usable variables from the filtered data and combines them into the final dataset

   - [**EDA.ipynb**](EDA.ipynb): Exploratory Data Analysis to show distributions of exploratory variables and relationship with response variable

   - [**Prediction_models.ipynb**](Prediction_models.ipynb): Trains and compares prediction models
